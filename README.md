# HTML5 Video EveryWhere

Higher performance and stable sideo watching experience on the web.

Some streaming sites video players suck. This add-on will replace them with
browser built-in video player for higher performance and more stable
experience. Currently, it supports YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, Dailymotion,
Break, Metacafe, Lego and even more sites are coming.

This extension will change the page content of the supported video streaming
sites. As a result, many extensions that depends on this content may not work
as expected.
